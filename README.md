# Overview



{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}
I wrote a simple username and password verifier as a class in c++ which demonstrates the ability to take user input, and compare it to a long list of possible correct options. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
It is a modular program which forms the core of many of these types of comparisons. It is bare bones and lacks security, but the module itself need not even change much over time to accomodate them, as they would be handled by other processes 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used a free online compiler to actually run and check my code, as the process kept failing on VScode 
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used the C++ language to develop this code.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1

expand the security on the passwords and usernames 

- Item 2

externalize the list into a file

- Item 3

add scalability and the ability to add or remove username/password combinations
